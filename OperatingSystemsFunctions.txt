Memory management, where the operating handles and manages the primary memory and moves the processes back and forth between the main memory and the secondary memory such as hard drive during execution. However, the memory management also keeps track of all memory locations even if they are allocated to some processor. It also keeps track of the amount of memory that is allocated to specific processes. 
CPU scheduling where the operating system is similar to the Memory manager, but instead of allocating the memory, it allocates the access to the CPU. It used a different type of scheduling algorithms to perform this task. The algorithm it uses depends on the OS programmer.
An Operating System manages device communication via their respective drivers. It does the following activities for device management. It Keeps tracks of all devices and decides which process gets the device when and for how much time.
